# BAN-693T-Capstone-Project
Some say climate change is the biggest threat of our age while others say itâ€™s a myth based on dodgy science. The dataset contains 263 years of data with a measurement performed every month. The dataset has been compiled by the Berkeley Earth Research group, courtesy of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

# Problem Statement:
Use time series techniques to forecast temperature 100 years into the future.
This should allow to conclusively establish global warming and predict the magnitude of temperature increase due to it with reasonable accuracy.
